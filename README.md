# hoover_project

This Project solves a challenge where there is a Grid which represents a room. Imagine you are a roomba and are given instructions to move throughout a room. Throughout the room there are pieces of dirt and if the instructions given to the roomba run over a piece of dirt it will be counted towards your dirt pickup count.
